# Pet Care 101 - Complete Guide

Just as we require nutritious meals for good health, our pets thrive on quality food too. Importantly, quality pet food goes beyond the brand. Each species also has their own unique dietary needs.

## Quality Food & Fresh Water

### Cats & Dogs

Can we give dog food to our cats, and cat food to our dogs?

The short answer is no, their diets are not interchangeable.

**Cats are obligate carnivores.** This means that they eat mostly meat and that their bodies are unable to properly digest plant matter. On the other hand, **dogs are omnivores** who eat both plant and animal sources of food.

Besides this difference, cats and dogs do share some similarities in their dietary requirements:

### Types of Food

Commercial pet food or home-prepared food? Cooked or raw? Dry or wet?

Let us understand what each type of food brings to the (dining) table:

**Home-prepared food** tends to be fresh but will likely be imbalanced in nutrients unless recommended by a veterinary nutritionist.

**Cooked food** contains lower levels of bacteria than raw food and is safer for pets with lower immunity. However, raw food may help manage some medical problems, e.g. gastrointestinal issues, lack of appetite, obesity, and coat condition. It is important to ensure that raw food is stored correctly and safely.

**Commercial pet food** is made to meet the dietary needs of an average pet:
- **Dry food** is a more affordable option than wet food, although it is low in water content and tends to have non-essential fillers (e.g. grains)
- **Wet food** tends to be more palatable than dry food and has a higher water content which helps your pet stay hydrated

### Tips for Identifying High Quality Pet Food

Here are some tips for identifying high quality options to keep your pet hale and hearty:

- Read online reviews to see what others say
- Look at the ingredients list on the food packaging. The first two or three ingredients should be meat protein (e.g. chicken, fish) and not meat by-products, bone meal, or grains
- Beware of unidentified meat or toxic preservatives such as BHA and BHT

### Life Stage Appropriateness

Some pet foods are marketed as "for all life stages" which sounds versatile but may not sufficiently address the dietary requirements of each life stage. For example:

**Kittens and puppies** are at a rapid stage of development and need more nutrients (e.g. protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals) that are carefully balanced. Their caloric intake should also be higher to support their growth and activity levels.

**Adult pets** (about 1–6 years old) are in a maintenance stage and no longer need such a nutrient-rich diet. Otherwise, they may be at risk of obesity and associated health conditions like arthritis since excess weight puts greater pressure on the joints. Their choice of diet would depend on their activity levels, sterilisation status, and whether they are indoor pet cats or outdoor community cats, amongst other factors. In general, sterilised indoor cats who are less active have lower metabolisms and need fewer calories.

**Senior pets** (usually above 6 years old) tend to have a slower pace of life and lower metabolism. They are also at higher risk of diseases like diabetes and kidney failure. By offering a lower-calorie diet with less protein and sodium, we can help them stay healthy for longer.

### Prescription Diets for Medical Conditions

If your pet has a medical condition, your vet may recommend a prescription diet to help manage the condition. These diets are only available from veterinary clinics on a prescription basis.

Unless advised by your vet, do not switch your pet back to regular food as this may cause health complications. For example, a Kidney Care diet is specially formulated for balanced protein intake. This is important for pets with kidney disease as too much protein can lead to a buildup of toxins in the blood, while too little protein can lead to a loss of muscle mass.

### Feeding Frequency

Some pets are fed once a day, twice, or even thrice. It often depends on your pet's requirements and the family schedule. However, it is not advisable to allow free access to food all day as this encourages overeating and obesity which leads to a host of health problems. Free feeding may also cause tummy upsets if the food goes bad from being left out in the open for too long.

## Small Animals

### Rabbits & Guinea Pigs

Rabbits and guinea pigs are both strict herbivores and share similarities in their diet:

- Up to 6 months of age, provide alfalfa hay as it is rich in nutrients needed for the young rabbit or guinea pig to grow.
- Beyond 6 months of age, offer unlimited timothy hay as adult rabbits and guinea pigs can no longer process the high calcium content in alfalfa hay which may then lead to kidney or bladder stones.
- Provide quality pellets in a moderate amount to avoid overeating and obesity.
- Dark leafy vegetables are an excellent choice for both rabbits and guinea pigs.
- Contrary to popular media (think Bugs Bunny), root vegetables such as carrots are high in sugar and should only be given as an occasional treat.

**Important:** Guinea pigs cannot make their own Vitamin C. While some commercial pellets have added Vitamin C, it is unstable and degrades over time. This means your piggies will need you to provide this essential nutrient in their diet. Foods high in Vitamin C include kale, parsley, and spinach.

### Hamsters

Hamsters are omnivores and eat a mixture of pellets, seeds, fruits, and mealworms.

For a balanced diet, offer your hammy a quality seed mix. Sunflower seeds are best reserved as an occasional treat as they are high in fat and low in nutrients. This can lead to obesity and malnutrition if sunflower seeds are given as the main source of food.

**Interesting fact:** Hamsters are coprophagic which means that they eat their own poop. This allows their body to redigest and absorb any nutrients that they missed the first time.

## Clean & Safe Space

Regardless of your pet's species, it is important to:

- Provide a clean and well-ventilated environment that they feel safe in, with ample room for them to move around comfortably.
- Set up separate areas for eating, drinking, resting, playing, and toileting. Maintain sufficient distance between their eating/drinking and toileting areas to avoid contamination.
- Protect them from extreme conditions such as loud noises, heat, and strong wind.
- Keep them away from dangerous or toxic household items, scents, and foods.

### Cats & Dogs

Ideally, cats and dogs should be free to roam indoors as long as the accessible areas are safe. The SPCA only recommends caging or confining your pets if there are medical issues. If your pet is confined to a cage or playpen (e.g. bedrest to recover from injury), be sure to let them out for supervised exercise daily.

Ensure your pets have the option to move to a shaded area, and never leave them outside the house. Some breeds (e.g. Huskies) thrive in a cold climate and may not do as well in hot weather. You can help by providing adequate shade and a cool space by turning on the fan or air-conditioning.

If your cat uses a litter box, spot-clean it at least twice a day. Once a week at least, empty and wash out the litter box before filling it with fresh litter. Cats are fastidiously clean and will let you know if your cleaning is not up to standard – by peeing or pooping outside of their litter box.

For multi-cat households, the recommended number of litter boxes would be [number of cats] + 1. This means three litter boxes for two cats, four litter boxes for three cats, etc. By doing this, you are giving your cats more options as some may refuse to share litter boxes or avoid using a soiled one.

### Small Animals

**Rabbits & Guinea Pigs**

Rabbits and guinea pigs have delicate feet – rabbits have only coarse fur (no foot pads) while guinea pigs have furless feet. To protect them from soreness or injury, choose solid-bottomed enclosures instead of wired ones.

Spot-clean the enclosure daily and clean it out every week. This prevents fur mites and fungal infections which guinea pigs are susceptible to.

If you have more than one rabbit or guinea pig, consider their compatibility when deciding between group housing and solo housing:

- Guinea pigs are social and thrive in pairs. If you have a single guinea pig, invest more time in meeting his/her socialisation needs.
- Rabbits should be carefully paired or housed separately as not all of them get along. If you observe any serious fights, keep them separate when unsupervised and gradually reintroduce them again.

Importantly, both rabbits and guinea pigs are prolific breeders so ensure that male-female pairs are sterilised or house them separately.

Rabbits tend to be happiest when allowed to roam freely in a bunny-proofed home. They can be toilet-trained too! However, avoid pine and cedar litter as they are linked to elevated liver enzymes in rabbits. Instead, it is safer to use straw, wood shavings, or recycled paper litter.

**Hamsters**

Each hamster should have his/her own cage to prevent breeding and fighting. Hamsters are territorial and their fights can be serious or even fatal.

Provide an enclosure that is large enough for exploration (at least 90x50x50cm) and has sufficiently deep bedding for digging. Use straw, wood shavings, or recycled paper litter for bedding as pine and cedar litter are linked to elevated liver enzymes in hamsters. Spot-clean the enclosure daily and clean it out every week.

Because hamsters like to gnaw on things, check their cage often to ensure there is no damage that can cause harm (e.g. rusty metal bars) or lead to escape.

Hamsters like being in contact with objects rather than out in an open space. There is a cool term for this: they are positively thigmotactic! You can help your hamster feel comfortable by providing boxes, tunnels, and walls that they can snuggle up to.

## Exercise & Enrichment

Pets of all species will benefit from exercise and enrichment to keep their minds and bodies engaged, although the types of activity differ based on species and the personality of your pet.

### Cats & Dogs

Toys are not just limited to playtime! They are also a fantastic way to make mealtimes fun for your pet, and they need not be expensive toys either.

**Socialisation** (exposure to humans and different environments) is critical in helping our pets adjust to communal living. While older cats and dogs can and should still be socialised, the optimal time period is generally:

- 2 to 7 weeks of age for cats
- 3 to 14 weeks of age for dogs

Dogs need daily walks, with most dogs doing well with one to two walks a day unless otherwise advised by the vet. Brisk walks allow dogs to expend their energy while slower walks offer a chance for them to wander and sniff (aka "sniffaris"), leading you along as they explore their environment.

In training your dog to walk on a leash, be sure to use positive reinforcement. For all dogs, it is strongly recommended to engage a qualified trainer who uses force-free and evidence-based methods. Think of a trainer as someone who coaches you on how to work with your dog, not as someone who simply trains your dog. Over time and with proper guidance, your dog will gain confidence, learn skills, overcome any fears, and develop trusting relationships.

For cats, offer an enriching indoor environment such as by having scratching posts, perches, and interactive toys. Many cats love a good chase with a wand toy, and it is a perfect opportunity for you to bond with them.

So long as we provide a rich indoor experience, outdoor adventures are not essential. Some people find it cruel to keep cats indoors, but it is really an act of kindness. Studies have shown that strictly indoor cats live longer than outdoor cats due to lower risks of danger (e.g. falling from height, getting lost or involved in traffic accidents, cat fights, and attacks by dogs).

### Small Animals

Small animals enjoy foraging and burrowing, so be sure to create a wholesome environment that supports these behaviours. Lack of exploration could be a sign that your pet is unwell.

Interact with your pet by petting, holding, and playing with them. This gets them used to human handling, promotes bonding, and is also a way for you monitor their health by feeling for any new lumps or changes in their skin quality.

Because small animals are fragile and easily startled, it is highly recommended that you handle them while sitting down. This will reduce the risks of severe injury if you were to accidentally drop them. It is also not advisable to bring your rabbit out for events as changes in the environment can be extremely stressful for them.

Some pets do not enjoy human handling no matter how hard you try. Take the cue from your pet and interact in ways that he/she seems comfortable with.

Enrich your pet's enclosure by offering hiding spots and foraging activities, e.g. hiding their food in burrows and toys. Bringing them out into a larger exercise pen can provide a refreshing change in environment and more play options.

Unlike humans, the teeth of small animals grow throughout life. Gnawing and chewing are therefore critical to keep their teeth in check. Overgrown teeth can cut into gums, cause ulcers, interfere with eating, and even make swallowing difficult. You can help your pet by offering a range of safe items to chew on.

## Regular Grooming

Regular grooming keeps your pet looking sharp and feeling good. It generally involves:

- Brushing to remove loose hairs and prevent matting, especially for longhaired pets
- Nail clipping (be careful to only clip the white part of the nail)
- Brushing teeth using a pet-friendly toothpaste and brush
- Baths when necessary, using pet-friendly cleansing agents

If you are not confident in grooming your pet, seek the help of a professional groomer.

## Regular Vet Visits

It is important to take your pets to the vet for annual checkups or whenever they show signs of being unwell. Regular checkups allow early identification and treatment of any illnesses. This helps to restore your pet's health quickly and also saves on vet expenses in the long-term.

During visits, also seek advice from your vet on:

- Vaccinations
- Preventative care which protects your pet against fleas, ticks, and parasites
- Common illnesses for your pet's species and how to keep them at bay

Before giving your pet any medication, always ask your vet if it is safe. Different species (and individual pets of the same species) may react differently to the same medication. For example, some antibiotics and flea treatments can be toxic to rabbits.

## Responsible Pet Ownership

Remember that pet ownership is a long-term commitment that requires time, effort, and resources. Always consider your lifestyle, living situation, and ability to provide proper care before bringing a pet into your home. If you're struggling with pet care, don't hesitate to reach out to local animal welfare organizations for support and guidance.

The SPCA Community Animal Clinic offers heavily subsidised services to pet guardians on financial assistance. If your pet needs medical attention or procedures like microchipping and sterilisation, please book an appointment with our clinic.

Because we run Singapore's only non-profit community animal clinic, we also serve animals under the care of other animal welfare groups, rescuers, and community caregivers. This means that our resources are limited. While we do our best to help as many people as possible, we seek your understanding that we may need to prioritise providing aid to those who are most in need.
